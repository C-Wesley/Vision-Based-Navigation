# Vision-Based-Navigation
### Augusta University Drone Research
This project is led by a team of researchers working for the Augusta University School of Computer and Cyber Sciences. The goal is to create navigation software for groups 
of autonomus flight drones using a camera vision based approach where localization of flight drones will primarily be handled by a classification neural network.

# Additional Large Files are Required
Somes files were striped from the repository to save space. These files include the trained neural network, the folder that contained all the training filed, and the data sets the model was trained on. These files are accessable via: https://augustauniversity.box.com/s/yciwvr19u4xg2xt3nyvbltxcjfr4yyvb

There are two required folders from the above link. The folders entitled "model" and "annotations" belong in the "project/resources" folder. 

A <a href="https://github.com/C-Wesley/Vision-Based-Navigation/blob/main/envrionment%20setup/Windows%20Env%20Setup.txt" target="_blank">set-up</a> 
guide has been provided, and higher-end Nvidia GPU support is recommended. Any questions concerning this project can be sent to either
