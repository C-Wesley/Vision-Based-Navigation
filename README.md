# Vision-Based-Navigation
### Augusta University Drone Research
This project is led by a team of researchers working for the Augusta University School of Computer and Cyber Sciences. The goal is to create navigation software for groups 
of autonomus flight drones using a camera vision based approach where localization of flight drones will primarily be handled by a classification neural network.
