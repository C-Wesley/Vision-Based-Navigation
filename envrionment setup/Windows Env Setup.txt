## Windows Machine Installation ##

Visit https://augustauniversity.box.com/s/yciwvr19u4xg2xt3nyvbltxcjfr4yyvb
and download the folders named "model" and "annotations".

Place these folders inside the "project/resources" folder.

Install Anaconda Python and Git for Windows.

Create a Python3 conda envrionment- 
    conda create -n <env> python=3.x
    (to remove conda envs do: conda env remove -n <env>) 

Activate the conda envrionment and install tensorflow
    conda activate <env>
    pip install tensorflow

Navigate to a folder of you choosing 
and clone the models folder from Tensorflow
    git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models

Install protoc and add it to your Path
Run the following command from the 
./models/research folder of the tensorflow clone 
    protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.

To ensure the protoc command ran correctly,
navigate to the ./models/research/object_detection/protos folder.
Ensure there are .py files. 

Navigate to ./models/research/object_detection/packages/tf2 folder.
Copy setup.py to research folder. 

Run the following commands from the research folder: 

    pip install cython

    pip install git+https://github.com/philferriere/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

The install command may take a while.
It is installing dependencies. 
Make sure it doesn't get stuck trying 
to resolve a specific package. 

Noted on 5/31/22 pyparsing will throw an issue when running the test for TF2.
This can be resolved by running the following command:
    pip instll httplib2

To ensure everything is working run the following command from the research folder
    python object_detection/builders/model_builder_tf2_test.py

If this runs without fail, Congrats! Everything is ready to go!

If you have a gpu, now is the time to look into 
setting up gpu support for tensorflow. 

To install tensorflow, first install the CUDA tool kit. 
Under advanced installation, turn off physx, gefore experince, and the optional drivers. 
Only install CUDA. 
    https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11.2.2-download-archive?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=10&target_type=exenetwork
   
Download cuDNN v8.1.0 (January 26th, 2021) from (it's a zip file)
    https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive#a-collapse810-111
    
Once CUDA is done installing, navigate to where it installed at. 
It will look something like this: 
    C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.2

Extract the zip file from the cuDNN
