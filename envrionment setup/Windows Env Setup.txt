## Windows Machine Installation ##

Install Anaconda Python and Git for Windows.

Create a Python3 conda envrionment- 
    conda create -n <env> python=3.x
    (to remove conda envs do: conda env remove -n <env>) 

Activate the conda envrionment and install tensorflow
    conda activate <env>
    pip install tensorflow

Navigate to a folder of you choosing 
and clone the models folder from Tensorflow
    git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models

Install protoc and add it to your Path
Run the following command from the 
./models/research folder of the tensorflow clone 
    protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.

To ensure the protoc command ran correctly,
navigate to the ./models/research/object_detection/protos folder.
Ensure there are .py files. 

Navigate to ./models/research/object_detection/packages/tf2 folder.
Copy setup.py to research folder. 

Run the following commands from the research folder: 

    pip install cython

    pip install git+https://github.com/philferriere/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

The install command may take a while.
It is installing dependencies. 
Make sure it doesn't get stuck trying 
to resolve a specific package. 

To ensure everything is working run the following command from the research folder
    python object_detection/builders/model_builder_tf2_test.py

If this runs without fail, Congrats! Everything is ready to go!

If you have a gpu, now is the time to look into 
setting up gpu support for tensorflow.
